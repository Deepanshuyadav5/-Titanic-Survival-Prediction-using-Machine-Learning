# -Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
I built a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on features like age, gender, and passenger class.
🛠️ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
📈 Model: KNeighborsClassifier
🔍 Project Highlights:

Data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pattern discovery

KNN model training and evaluation using accuracy & confusion matrix

Predicted outcomes on new passenger data for real-world testing
